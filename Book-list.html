		<div class="content">
			Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows plays thoughtfully upon the standard Harry Potter formula that 
			we've all gotten used to over the course of the last six books - we begin with a menacing taste of what's to come 
			(this time with a glimpse of what Voldemort and his Death Eaters are up to), find ourselves at Privet Drive at the end of the summer, 
			and then make our way to Hogwarts. However, this version of the trajectory is thwarted at every point,
			as Rowling throws in curveball after curveball, shaking up all of our expectations.

		<div class="content">
			At the beginning of the story, Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark executes a deserter from the Night's Watch, 
			who has betrayed his vows and fled from the Wall. On the way back, his children adopt six direwolf pups, 
			the animal of his sigil. There are three male and two female direwolf pups, as well as an albino runt, 
			which aligns with his three trueborn sons, two trueborn daughters, and one bastard son. 
			That night, Ned receives word of the death of his mentor, Lord Jon Arryn, the principal advisor to Ned's childhood friend, King Robert Baratheon. 
			During his own visit to Ned's castle of Winterfell, Robert recruits Ned to replace Arryn as the King's Hand. 
			Ned is reluctant, but agrees to go when he learns that Arryn's widow Lysa believes Queen Cersei Lannister and her family poisoned Arryn. 
			Shortly thereafter, Ned's son Bran inadvertently discovers Cersei in coitus with her twin brother Jaime Lannister, who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair.

			It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.
			While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. 
			As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.
